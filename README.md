# House_prices
Kaggle | House Prices
A tutorial project based on https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques.
The project included:
1. Primary analysis and processing of tabular data;
2. Data visualization;
3. Development of a model that predicts the cost of houses depending on their parameters.

The main aim of the project was gain experience in data processing and visualization using Pandas and visualization libraries (Matplotlib and Seaborn). 
There was no goal to achieve highest score, so model is quite simple and final score is moderate - 0.14925 (61th percentile).
